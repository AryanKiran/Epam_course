"Summertime Sadness" by Lana Del Rey:

[Verse 1]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, oh

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

[Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive

[Chorus]
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
